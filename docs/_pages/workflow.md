TODO: Update this to reflect the new post-baseline workflow.

This note describes the high-level workflow that Alec used for creating the maps for this study:

(1) Copied the Official maps

(2) Copied the Notable Maps

(3) Pulled the ratings for these maps

Then, for each state:

(4) Created a baseline map using [the 'baseline' workflow](baseline_workflow.md) 

(5) Imported the baseline map into DRA

(6) Opened it in DRA & tweaked a few settings

(7) Tweaked each duplicated Official and Notable map in DRA

(8) Analyzed the Official & Notable maps relative to the baseline map

(9) Added population deviation & runtimes to the abstract spreadsheet
	
(10) Turn the state on in the website
