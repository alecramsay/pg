This describes the workflow for creating the maps for this site.

(1) Copy Official maps
* Snapshot Official map ids in pg/constants.py -- DONE
* Copy the Official maps, using the duplicate_official_maps.py script -- DONE

  For each new map in DRA -- DONE

* Set the Colors and Overlays
* Collect the id into pg/constants.py
* Export it

(2) Copy Notable Maps
* Snapshot Notable map ids in pg/constants.py -- DONE
* Copy Notable maps, using the duplicate_notable_maps.py script -- DONE

  For each new map in DRA -- DONE

* Set the Colors and Overlays
* Collect the id into pg/constants.py
* Export it

(3) Pull the ratings for the duplicated Official and Notable maps, using the pull_ratings.py script -- DONE

Then, for each state:

(4) Create a baseline map using [the 'baseline' workflow](baseline-workflow.md)

(5) Import the map into DRA, using the import_base_map.sh script

(6) Open the map in DRA:

* Set the Colors and Overlays -- 'Change Palette' to Plasma
* Copy the Share link guid to constants.py in both the 'baseline' and 'pg' repos
* Export the block-assignment file
* Rename it to XX_2020_Congress_Baseline.csv <<< NOTE - 2020 not 2022, and 'Baseline' not 'baseline'
* Move it to the data/XX/ folder

(7) For each duplicated Official and Notable map in DRA:

* Turn District Lines on
* Turn on the background map
* [Change Palette] to Plasma
* Add the baseline map as a Custom Overlay -- no fill, no labels, (line thickness = 1)
* Download the map image, using right-click in Chrome
* Rename it to XX_2022_Congress_<label>_map.png <<< NOTE - 2022 not 2020!
* Move it to the docs/assets/images/ folder

(8) Analyze the Official & Notable maps, using the analyze_state.py script

(9) Add population deviation & runtime to the abstract spreadsheet

	cat intermediate/XX/XX20C_log_100.txt | awk 'END{print}'
	
(10) Turn the state on in the website

* Add the Share link guid to states.yml and flip the 'ready' property for the state to 'true'
* On the state's page in docs/_pages/pages/XX.markdown, change the layout to 'state' and remove the NYI one-liner
