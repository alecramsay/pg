This note describes the high-level workflow that Alec used for creating the maps for this study:

(1) Copied the Official maps

(2) Copied the Notable Maps

(3) This was pulling the ratings for these maps. In the re-work, that is integrated into the analysis step below.

Then, for each state:

(4) Created a baseline map using [the 'baseline' workflow](baseline_workflow.md) 

(5) Analyzed the official & notable maps relative to the baseline map

(6) Added population deviation & runtimes to the abstract spreadsheet
	
(7) Turned the state on in the website
