This note describes the high-level workflow that Alec used for creating the maps for this study:

(1) Copied the Official maps from DRA

(2) Copied the Notable Maps from DRA

Then, for each state:

(3) Created a baseline map using [the 'baseline' workflow](baseline_workflow.markdown) 

(4) Analyzed the official & notable maps relative to the baseline map
