The baseline congressional districts are maximally proportional (100),
have relatively good opportunity for minority representation (88) and compactness (75),
but poor competitiveness (22) and county-district splitting (0).

- Competitiveness can be maximized (22 &#x2192; 92) while improving county-district splitting substantially (0 &#x2192; 48) and without giving up on other baseline values.
- Opportunity for minority representation can be improved somewhat (82 &#x2192; 100) while also improving county-district splitting substantially (0 &#x2192; 40).
- Compactness can only be improved marginally (75 &#x2192; 88) without other tradeoffs.
- County-district splitting can be minimized at the expense of some compactness (75 &#x2192; 33).

Those are the policy tradeoffs. 
An average of 62% of population-weighted precincts assignments are shared between notable maps and the baseline.

Relative to the baseline map, 
the official map reduces county-district splitting significantly (0 &#x2192; 45) at the expense of significant compactness (75 &#x2192; 35).
