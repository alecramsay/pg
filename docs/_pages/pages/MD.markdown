The Baseline congressional districts are maximally proportional (100),
have relatively good opportunity for minority representation (88) and compactness (75),
but poor competitiveness (22) and county-district splitting (0).

These are some major quantifiable policy tradeoffs, relative to the Baseline map:

-   **Most Proportional** &#8212; This map is more competitive and splits fewer counties &amp; districts
    (22 &#x2192; 82 and 0 &#x2192; 48, respectively). 
-   **Most Competitive** &#8212; This map is more competitive (22 &#x2192; 82) and 
    splits fewer counties &amp; districts (0 &#x2192; 48) without giving up on other ratings.
-   **Best Minority** &#8212; This map has more opportunity for minority representation (82 &#x2192; 100) and
    splits fewer counties &amp; districts (0 &#x2192; 40).
-   **Most Compact** &#8212; This map is more compact (75 &#x2192; 88) 
    without other tradeoffs.
-   **Least Splitting** &#8212; This map splits fewer counties &amp; districts (0 &#x2192; 86) 
    but is less compact (75 &#x2192; 33).

An average of 62% of population-weighted precincts assignments are shared between the Notable and Baseline maps.
