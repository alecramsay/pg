The baseline congressional districts are naturally relatively proportional and compact (81 and 79, respectively),
but have only moderate competitiveness (56) and opportunity for minority representation (50), and poor county-district splitting (14).

-   Proportionality can be improved somewhat (81 &#x2192; 100) without giving up on other baseline values.
    County-district splitting can also be significantly improved at the same time (14 &#x2192; 76).
-   Competitiveness can be maximized (56 &#x2192; 100) at the expense of compactness (79 &#x2192; 24).
-   Opportunity for minority representation can be maximized (50 &#x2192; 92) at the expense of both compactness (79 &#x2192; 26) and competitiveness (56 &#x2192; 17).
-   Compactness can also be improved somewhat (79 &#x2192; 98) but at the expense of some competitiveness (56 &#x2192; 35).
-   County-district splitting can be minimized (14 &#x2192; 90) at the expense of some competitiveness (56 &#x2192; 28).

Those are the policy tradeoffs.
An average of 62% of population-weighted precincts assignments are shared between notable maps and the baseline.

The official map was ordered by the NC Supreme Court and challenged in Moore v. Harper.
Relative to the baseline map, it reduces county-district splitting significantly (14 &#x2192; 57) 
at the expense of some compactness (79 &#x2192; 61) and competitiveness (56 &#x2192; 30).
