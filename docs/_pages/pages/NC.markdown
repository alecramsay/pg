The baseline congressional districts are naturally relatively proportional and compact (81 and 79, respectively),
but have only moderate competitiveness (56) and opportunity for minority representation (50), and poor county-district splitting (14).

- Proportionality can be improved somewhat (81 &#x2192; 100) without giving up on other baseline values. 
- Competitiveness can be maximized (56 &#x2192; 100) at the expense of compactness (79 &#x2192; 24).
- Opportunity for minority representation can be maximized (50 &#x2192; 92) at the expense of both compactness (79 &#x2192; 26) and competitiveness (56 &#x2192; 17).
- Compactness can also be improved somewhat (79 &#x2192; 98) but at the expense of some competitiveness (56 &#x2192; 35).
- County-district splitting can be minimized (14 &#x2192; 90) at the expense of some competitiveness (56 &#x2192; 28).

Those are the policy tradeoffs.
An average of 62% of population-weighted precincts assignments are shared between a notable map and the baseline.

The official map was ordered by the NC Supreme Court and challenged in Moore v. Harper.
Relative to the baseline map, 
the it reduces county-district splitting significantly (14 &#x2192; 57) 
at the expense of some compactness (79 &#x2192; 61) and
competitiveness (56 &#x2192; 30).
