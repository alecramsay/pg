The baseline congressional districts in NC are naturally relatively proportional and compact (81 and 79, respectively),
but have only moderate competitiveness (56) and opportunity for minority representation (50), and poor county-district splitting (14).

- Proportionality can be maximized (81 -> 100) somewhat without giving up on other baseline values. 
- Compactness can also be maximized (79 -> 98) somewhat but at the expense of some competitiveness (56 -> 35).
- Competitiveness can be maximized (56 -> 100) at the expense of compactness (79 -> 24).
- Opportunity for minority representation can be maximized (50 -> 92) at the expense of both compactness (79 -> 26) and competitiveness (56 -> 17).
- County-district splitting can be minimized at the expense of some competitiveness (56 -> 28).
