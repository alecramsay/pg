The Baseline congressional districts are naturally relatively proportional and compact (81 and 79, respectively),
but have only moderate competitiveness (56) and opportunity for minority representation (50) and poor county-district splitting (14).

Those are some major quantifiable policy tradeoffs:

-   **Proportionality** &#8212; The Most Proportional map is somewhat proportional than the Baseline map (81 &#x2192; 100) 
    without giving up on other Baseline ratings.
    At the same time, it is also much better on county-district splitting than the Baseline map (14 &#x2192; 76).
-   **Competitiveness** &#8212; The Most Competitive map is much more competitive than the Baseline map (56 &#x2192; 100) 
    but much less compact as a result (79 &#x2192; 24).
-   **Minority** &#8212; The Best Minority map has much better opportunity for minority representation than the Baseline map (50 &#x2192; 92) 
    but is much less compact (79 &#x2192; 26) and competitive (56 &#x2192; 17) as a consequence.
-   **Compactness** &#8212; The Most Compact map is somewhat more compact than the Baseline map (79 &#x2192; 98) 
    but is somewhat less competitive (56 &#x2192; 35).
-   **Splitting** &#8212; The Least Splitting map splits far fewer counties &amp; districts than the Baseline map (14 &#x2192; 90) 
    but is somewhat less competitiven (56 &#x2192; 28).

An average of 62% of population-weighted precincts assignments are shared between notable maps and the baseline.

The Official map was ordered by the NC Supreme Court and challenged in Moore v. Harper.
Relative to the Baseline map, it splits many fewer counties &amp; districts (14 &#x2192; 57)
but is less competitive (56 &#x2192; 30) and is a little less compact (79 &#x2192; 61).
