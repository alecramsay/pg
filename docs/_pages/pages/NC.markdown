The Baseline congressional districts are naturally relatively proportional and compact (81 and 79, respectively),
but have only moderate competitiveness (56) and opportunity for minority representation (50) and poor county-district splitting (14).

These are some major quantifiable policy tradeoffs, relative to the Baseline map:

-   The **Most Proportional** map is more proportional (81 &#x2192; 100) 
    without giving up on other ratings.
    At the same time, it splits fewer counties &amp; districts (14 &#x2192; 76).
-   The **Most Competitive** map is more competitive (56 &#x2192; 100) 
    but less compact (79 &#x2192; 24).
-   The **Best Minority** map has greater opportunity for minority representation (50 &#x2192; 92) 
    but is less compact (79 &#x2192; 26) and less competitive (56 &#x2192; 17).
-   The **Most Compact** map is more compact (79 &#x2192; 98) 
    but is less competitive (56 &#x2192; 35).
-   The **Least Splitting** map splits fewer counties &amp; districts (14 &#x2192; 90) 
    but is less competitive (56 &#x2192; 28).

An average of 62% of population-weighted precinct assignments are shared between the Notable and Baseline maps.

The Official map was ordered by the NC Supreme Court and challenged in Moore v. Harper.
Relative to the Baseline map, it splits fewer counties &amp; districts (14 &#x2192; 57)
but is less competitive (56 &#x2192; 30) and is less compact (79 &#x2192; 61).
