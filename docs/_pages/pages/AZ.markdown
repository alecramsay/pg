The baseline congressional districts have middling proportionality (71), 
opportunity for minority representation (67), and compactness (70), and
poor competitiveness (32) and county-district splitting (21).

All five dimensions can be improved upon and nearly optimized at the same time without tradeoffs
(71 &#x2192; 100, 32 &#x2192; 100, 67 &#x2192; 98, 70 &#x2192; 100, and 21 &#x2192; 83).

There are essentially no policy tradeoffs.
An average of 54% of population-weighted precincts assignments are shared between a notable map and the baseline.

Relative to the baseline map, 
the official map marginally improves proportionality (71 &#x2192; 82),
competitiveness (32 &#x2192; 44), and
opportunity for minority representation (67 &#x2192; 84)
at the expense of some compactness (70 &#x2192; 51).
