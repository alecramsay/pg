The Baseline congressional districts have middling proportionality (71), 
opportunity for minority representation (67), and compactness (70), and
poor competitiveness (32) and county-district splitting (21).

These are some major quantifiable policy tradeoffs, relative to the Baseline map:

-   The **Most Proportional** map is more proportional (71 &#x2192; 100) 
    and more proportional, compact, and splits fewer counties &amp; districts (71 &#x2192; 100, 70 &#x2192; 100, and 21 &#x2192; 80, respectively).
-   The **Most Competitive** map is more competitive (32 &#x2192; 100) 
    and more proportional, compact, and splits fewer counties &amp; districts (71 &#x2192; 100, 70 &#x2192; 100, and 21 &#x2192; 80, respectively).
-   The **Best Minority** map has more opportunity for minority representation (67 &#x2192; 98) 
    and is more competitive and splits fewer counties &amp; districts (32 &#x2192; 53 and 21 &#x2192; 52, respectively)
    but is less compact (70 &#x2192; 42).
-   The **Most Compact** map is more compact (70 &#x2192; 100) and also
    more proportional, more competitive, and splits fewer counties &amp; districts (71 &#x2192; 100, 32 &#x2192; 100, and 21 &#x2192; 80, respectively).
-   The **Least Splitting** map splits fewer counties &amp; districts (21 &#x2192; 85) 
    but less compact (70 &#x2192; 50).

An average of 54% of population-weighted precincts assignments are shared between the Notable and Baseline maps.

Relative to the Baseline map, 
the Official map is more proportional (71 &#x2192; 82),
more competitive (32 &#x2192; 44), and
has greater opportunity for minority representation (67 &#x2192; 84)
is less compact (70 &#x2192; 51).
