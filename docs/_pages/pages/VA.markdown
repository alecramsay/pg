The Baseline congressional districts are only moderately proportional (62) and compact (56) 
with only moderate opportunity for minority representation (60) and
have poor competitiveness (33) and county-district splitting (13).

These are some major quantifiable policy tradeoffs, relative to the Baseline map:

-   **Most Proportional** &#8212; This map is more proportional (62 &#x2192; 100) 
    and also splits fewer counties &amp; districts (13 &#x2192; 90).
-   **Most Competitive** &#8212; This map is more competitive (33 &#x2192; 85),
    more proportional (62 &#x2192; 95) and splits fewer counties &amp; districts (13 &#x2192; 40) 
    but less compact (56 &#x2192; 29).
-   **Best Minority** &#8212; This map has more opportunity for minority representation (60 &#x2192; 83) 
    and also more proportional (62 &#x2192; 100).
-   **Most Compact** &#8212; This map is more compact (56 &#x2192; 80) 
    without giving up on other baseline values.
-   **Least Splitting** &#8212; This map splits fewer counties &amp; districts (13 &#x2192; 94)
    but less compact (56 &#x2192; 27).

An average of 67% of population-weighted precincts assignments are shared between the Notable and Baseline maps.

Relative to the Baseline map, 
the Official map is more proportional (62 &#x2192; 100) while also splitting fewer counties &amp; districtst (13 &#x2192; 46).
