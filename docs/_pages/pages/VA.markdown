The baseline congressional districts are only moderately proportional (62) and compact (56) 
with only moderate opportunity for minority representation (60) and
have poor competitiveness (33) and county-district splitting (13).

- Proportionality can be improved significantly (62 &#x2192; 100) while also dramatically improving county-district splitting (13 &#x2192; 90).
- Competitiveness can be maximized (33 &#x2192; 85) while at the same time nearly maximizing proportionality (62 &#x2192; 95) and also improving county-district splitting somewhat (13 &#x2192; 40) at the expense of some compactness (56 &#x2192; 29).
- Opportunity for minority representation can be improved somewhat (60 &#x2192; 83) while at the same time maximizing proportionality (62 &#x2192; 100).
- Compactness can also be improved somewhat (56 &#x2192; 80) without giving up on other baseline values.
- County-district splitting can be minimized (13 &#x2192; 94) at the expense of some compactness (56 &#x2192; 27).

Those are the policy tradeoffs. 
An average of 67% of population-weighted precincts assignments are shared between a notable map and the baseline.

Relative to the baseline map, 
the official map improves proportionality significantly (62 &#x2192; 100) while also improving county-district splitting somewhat (13 &#x2192; 46).
