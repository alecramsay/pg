The baseline congressional districts are naturally relatively proportional and compact (85 and 75, respectively), 
but have only moderate competitiveness (47) and opportunity for minority representation (45) and poor county-district splitting (0).

-   Proportionality can be improved somewhat (85 &#x2192; 100) while also dramatically improving county-district splitting (0 &#x2192; 81).
-   Competitiveness can also be maximized (47 &#x2192; 100) while also dramatically improving county-district splitting (0 &#x2192; 71).
-   Opportunity for minority representation can be improved somewhat (45 &#x2192; 68) 
    at the expense of both compactness (75 &#x2192; 21) and some proportionality (85 &#x2192; 61).
-   Compactness can be improved somewhat (75 &#x2192; 100) along with county-district splitting (0 &#x2192; 42)
    but at the expense of some competitiveness (47 &#x2192; 29) and opportunity for minority representation (45 &#x2192; 31).
-   County-district splitting can be minimized (0 &#x2192; 99) 
    at the expense of some compactness (75 &#x2192; 29) and some proportionality (85 &#x2192; 71).

Those are the policy tradeoffs. 
An average of 57% of population-weighted precincts assignments are shared between a notable map and the baseline.

Relative to the baseline map, 
the official map improves county-district splitting (0 &#x2192; 37) 
at the expense of some compactness (75 &#x2192; 50) and some competitiveness (47 &#x2192; 33).
