The Baseline congressional districts are naturally relatively proportional and compact (85 and 75, respectively), 
but have only moderate competitiveness (47) and opportunity for minority representation (45) and poor county-district splitting (0).

These are some major quantifiable policy tradeoffs, relative to the Baseline map:

-   **Most Proportional** &#8212; This map is more proportional (85 &#x2192; 100) 
    and also splits fewer counties &amp; districts (0 &#x2192; 81).
-   **Most Competitive** &#8212; This map is more competitive (47 &#x2192; 100) 
    and also splits fewer counties &amp; districts (0 &#x2192; 71).
-   **Best Minority** &#8212; This map has more opportunity for minority representation (45 &#x2192; 68) 
    but is less compact (75 &#x2192; 21) and less proportional (85 &#x2192; 61).
-   **Most Compact** &#8212; This map is more compact (75 &#x2192; 100) 
    and also splits fewer counties &amp; districts (47 &#x2192; 29)
    but less competitive (47 &#x2192; 29) and has less opportunity for minority representation (45 &#x2192; 31).
-   **Least Splitting** &#8212; This map splits fewer counties &amp; districts (0 &#x2192; 99) 
    but is less compact(75 &#x2192; 29) and less proportional (85 &#x2192; 71).

An average of 57% of population-weighted precincts assignments are sharedbetween the Notable and Baseline maps.

Relative to the Baseline map, 
the official map improves county-district splitting (0 &#x2192; 37) 
at the expense of some compactness (75 &#x2192; 50) and some competitiveness (47 &#x2192; 33).
