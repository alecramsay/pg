The Baseline congressional districts are re naturally relatively proportional and compact (86 and 81, respectively),
have only moderate competitiveness (46) and opportunity for minority representation (47), and poor county-district splitting (0).

These are some major quantifiable policy tradeoffs:

-   **Proportionality** &#8212; The Most Proportional map is more proportional than the Baseline map (86 &#x2192; 100),
    has less county-district splitting (0 &#x2192; 73), and
    is less compact (81 &#x2192; 58).
-   **Competitiveness** &#8212; The Most Competitive map is more competitive than the Baseline map (46 &#x2192; 94) 
    but is less compact (81 &#x2192; 27).
-   **Minority** &#8212; The Best Minority map has more opportunity for minority representation than the Baseline map (47 &#x2192; 74) 
    but is less compact (81 &#x2192; 23).
-   **Compactness** &#8212; The Most Compact map is more compact than the Baseline map (81 &#x2192; 100)
    but less proportional (86 &#x2192; 0).
-   **Splitting** &#8212; The Least Splitting map splits fewer counties &amp; districts than the Baseline map (0 &#x2192; 89) 
    but is less compact (81 &#x2192; 46).

An average of 60% of population-weighted precincts assignments are shared between the Notable and Baseline maps.

Relative to the Baseline map, 
the Official map splits fewer counties &amp; districts (0 &#x2192; 58) 
but is less compact (81 &#x2192; 59).
