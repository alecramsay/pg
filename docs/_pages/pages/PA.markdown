The baseline congressional districts are naturally relatively proportional and compact (86 and 81, respectively),
have only moderate competitiveness (46) and opportunity for minority representation (47), and poor county-district splitting (0).

- Proportionality can be improved somewhat (86 &#x2192; 100) while also improving county-district splitting substantially (0 &#x2192; 73) but at the expense of some compactness (81 &#x2192; 58).
- Competitiveness can be maximized (46 &#x2192; 94) at the expense of compactness (81 &#x2192; 27).
- Opportunity for minority representation can be maximized (47 &#x2192; 74) again at the expense of compactness (81 &#x2192; 23).
- Compactness can also be improved somewhat (81 &#x2192; 100) at the extreme expense of proportionality (86 &#x2192; 0).
- County-district splitting can be minimized (0 &#x2192; 89) at the expense of compactness (81 &#x2192; 46).

Those are the policy tradeoffs.
An average of 60% of population-weighted precincts assignments are shared between notable maps and the baseline.

Relative to the baseline map, 
the official map reduces county-district splitting significantly (0 &#x2192; 58) 
at the expense of some compactness (81 &#x2192; 59).
