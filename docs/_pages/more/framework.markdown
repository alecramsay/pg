Aside from the obvious politics, 
one can think about the problem of drawing redistricting maps as involving three C's:

-   Constraints
-   Criteria, and
-   Context

Each is described below. This site introduces an important concept for understanding context: baseline districts.

### Constraints

Valid redistricting plans satisfy three basic requirements:[^1]

-   Complete &#8212; the whole state must be assigned to districts[^2]
-   Contiguous &#8212; every area within a district must be connected to
    every other area within the district, and have
-   'Roughly equal' populations &#8212; for congressional districts, the
    'roughly equal' threshold is \~0.75%.[^3]

While assessing whether a plan satisfies a requirement can require a
surprising amount of judgment in practice,[^4] one can think of these as
pass/fail constraints: a plan either satisfies the requirement or it
doesn't.

### Criteria

People consider many criteria when evaluating redistricting plans,
including:

-   Those with straightforward formulas, like measures of compactness
-   Much debated partisan measures of bias & responsiveness
-   How much counties, cities, and communities are split by districts
-   Whether districts are VRA compliant---a complex analysis that
    requires experts, and
-   More qualitative considerations for which there are no established
    metrics, such as the effects on incumbents and preservation of
    common core districts

In contrast to constraints, criteria have a better/worse dimension, even
if it is not readily quantifiable or there is debate about which metrics
are best.

Dave's Redistricting[^5] chose five reasonably quantifiable dimensions,
selected (or invented) raw metrics for each, and then normalized the raw
measurements to a common \[0--100\] scale where bigger is better.

-   Proportionality
-   Competitiveness
-   Opportunity for minority representation
-   Compactness, and
-   County--District splitting

For each of these dimensions, the published map with the highest rating
is anointed as a "notable" map.[^6]

### Context

Finally, and generally less well appreciated, redistricting in each
state is unique: the challenges, tradeoffs, and what is possible in
Maryland are different than in North Carolina. This is due to each
state's unique 'political geography': the geographic distribution of
people with different characteristics throughout the state.

This context can be further layered. At the most basic level, one can
label the total population for a state by census block the state's
'population geography': how many people live where without regard to
other characteristics, such as age, race & ethnicity, partisan lean,
etc. Political geography is a superset of population geography that
considers these other characteristics as well.

As this study demonstrates, 
the population geography of a state can be characterized by a set of "baseline districts."
