MIKE MATHIEU

(1) WHY are we showing baseline maps?

(2) "It seems like you separately have a belief that such a single point of comparison should/must exist 
    and be used as a basis for comparing (constructing?) maps."

(3) Least information / lowest entropy is solid.
 

Todd's summary:
(1) What is a baseline?
(2) Why should a baseline rely only on geography and population density (subject to legal constraints)?
(3) Why is a least-energy baseline a good baseline?
(4) Should we be calling one of our maps "the baseline" or just "a baseline" or "something else 
    that doesn't reference the word, 'baseline'"?

(1) "needs a precise definition that is intelligible for non-physicists. Both in mathematical terms 
    (but with no physics jargon, just standard formal notation) and layman terms."

(2) population compactness <=> respect/preserve political subdivisions
