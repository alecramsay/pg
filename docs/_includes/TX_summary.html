<p>The official congressional map makes trade-offs (-32, -13, 3, -38, 13) relative to the <b>root map</b> ratings [96,
  19, 74, 64, 0] to yield [64, 6, 77, 26, 13] proportionality, competitiveness, minority opportunity, compactness, and
  county-district splitting ratings, respectively.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <b>notable maps</b> suggest some major quantifiable policy trade-offs:</p>
<ul>

  <li>The Most Competitive map trades-off (4, 81, -6, -30, 21) for (100, 100, 68, 34, 21) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Best Minority map trades-off (4, 10, 12, -17, 41) for (100, 29, 86, 47, 41) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Compact map trades-off (4, 6, -1, 31, 24) for (100, 25, 73, 95, 24) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Least Splitting map trades-off (4, 2, -1, 6, 80) for (100, 21, 73, 70, 80) ratings.</li>
