<p>The official congressional map makes trade-offs (6, -13, -1, -7, 9) relative to the <b>root map</b> ratings [29, 20,
  85, 68, 0] to yield [35, 7, 84, 61, 9] proportionality, competitiveness, minority opportunity, compactness, and
  county-district splitting ratings, respectively.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <b>notable maps</b> suggest some major quantifiable policy trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Most Proportional map trades-off (71, 25, 7, -1, 92) for (100, 45, 92, 67, 92) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Competitive map trades-off (71, 80, 13, -33, 29) for (100, 100, 98, 35, 29) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Best Minority map trades-off (54, 32, 15, -4, 60) for (83, 52, 100, 64, 60) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Compact map trades-off (47, 14, 13, 25, 9) for (76, 34, 98, 93, 9) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Least Splitting map trades-off (71, 25, 7, -1, 92) for (100, 45, 92, 67, 92) ratings.</li>
