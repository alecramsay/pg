<p>The official congressional map makes trade-offs (-1, -5, 3, 12, 57) relative to the <b>root map</b> ratings (23, 8,
  22, 81, 24) to yield (22, 3, 25, 93, 81) proportionality, competitiveness, minority opportunity, compactness, and
  county-district splitting ratings, respectively.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <b>notable maps</b> suggest some major quantifiable policy trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Most Proportional map trades-off (77, 17, 15, -28, 52) for (100, 25, 37, 53, 76) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Competitive map trades-off (26, 73, -22, -37, 2) for (49, 81, 0, 44, 26) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Best Minority map trades-off (6, 2, 43, -56, -4) for (29, 10, 65, 25, 20) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Compact map trades-off (19, 8, 3, 19, 69) for (42, 16, 25, 100, 93) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Least Splitting map trades-off (8, 11, 3, 2, 71) for (31, 19, 25, 83, 95) ratings.</li>
