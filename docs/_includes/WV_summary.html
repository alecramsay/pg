<p>The official congressional map makes trade-offs (0, 0, 0, -30, 42) relative to the <b>root map</b> ratings [0, 0, 0,
  49, 58] to yield [0, 0, 0, 19, 100] proportionality, competitiveness, minority opportunity, compactness, and
  county-district splitting ratings, respectively.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <b>notable maps</b> suggest some major quantifiable policy trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Most Compact map trades-off (0, 0, 0, 21, 13) for (0, 0, 0, 70, 71) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Least Splitting map trades-off (0, 0, 0, 14, 42) for (0, 0, 0, 63, 100) ratings.</li>
</ul>
