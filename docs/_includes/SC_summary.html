<p>The official congressional map makes trade-offs (-29, -43, -19, -37, 7) relative to the <b>root map</b> ratings (29,
  50, 69, 74, 25) to yield (0, 7, 50, 37, 32) proportionality, competitiveness, minority opportunity, compactness, and
  county-district splitting ratings, respectively.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <b>notable maps</b> suggest some major quantifiable policy trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Most Proportional map trades-off (71, -20, 6, -3, 5) for (100, 30, 75, 71, 30) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Competitive map trades-off (37, 26, 2, -52, 2) for (66, 76, 71, 22, 27) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Best Minority map trades-off (36, -41, 31, -35, 7) for (65, 9, 100, 39, 32) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Compact map trades-off (16, 3, -19, 17, 6) for (45, 53, 50, 91, 31) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Least Splitting map trades-off (0, -4, -23, -23, 74) for (29, 46, 46, 51, 99) ratings.</li>
