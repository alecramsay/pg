<p>The official congressional map makes trade-offs (-24, -17, 0, -35, 32) relative to the <b>root map</b> ratings (76,
  23, 50, 66, 17) to yield (52, 6, 50, 31, 49) proportionality, competitiveness, minority opportunity, compactness, and
  county-district splitting ratings, respectively.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <b>notable maps</b> suggest some major quantifiable policy trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Most Proportional map trades-off (24, 1, 43, -27, 75) for (100, 24, 93, 39, 92) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Competitive map trades-off (24, 43, 41, -30, 3) for (100, 66, 91, 36, 20) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Best Minority map trades-off (24, -5, 47, -18, 17) for (100, 18, 97, 48, 34) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Compact map trades-off (24, -23, 23, 14, 28) for (100, 0, 73, 80, 45) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Least Splitting map trades-off (24, 1, 43, -18, 77) for (100, 24, 93, 48, 94) ratings.</li>
