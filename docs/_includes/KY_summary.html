<p>The official congressional map makes trade-offs (19, 12, 0, -37, 59) relative to the <b>root map</b> ratings (65, 4,
  0, 72, 33) to yield (84, 16, 0, 35, 92) proportionality, competitiveness, minority opportunity, compactness, and
  county-district splitting ratings, respectively.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <b>notable maps</b> suggest some major quantifiable policy trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Most Proportional map trades-off (35, 18, 0, -25, 63) for (100, 22, 0, 47, 96) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Competitive map trades-off (28, 60, 0, -47, 31) for (93, 64, 0, 25, 64) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Best Minority map trades-off (28, 16, 49, -52, -4) for (93, 20, 49, 20, 29) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Compact map trades-off (21, 14, 0, 20, 1) for (86, 18, 0, 92, 34) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Least Splitting map trades-off (34, 18, 0, -47, 64) for (99, 22, 0, 25, 97) ratings.</li>
