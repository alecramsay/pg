<p>The official congressional map makes trade-offs (-12, 0, 1, -24, 22) relative to the <b>root map</b> ratings [52,
  38, 49, 74, 18] to yield [40, 38, 50, 50, 40] proportionality, competitiveness, minority opportunity, compactness, and
  county-district splitting ratings, respectively.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <b>notable maps</b> suggest some major quantifiable policy trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Most Proportional map trades-off (48, -7, -2, 14, 61) for (100, 31, 47, 88, 79) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Competitive map trades-off (27, 62, -49, -35, 10) for (79, 100, 0, 39, 28) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Best Minority map trades-off (20, -3, 1, -20, 10) for (72, 35, 50, 54, 28) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Compact map trades-off (33, -16, -4, 25, 14) for (85, 22, 45, 99, 32) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Least Splitting map trades-off (18, 5, -2, -38, 76) for (70, 43, 47, 36, 94) ratings.</li>
