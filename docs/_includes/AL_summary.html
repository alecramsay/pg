<p>The official congressional map makes trade-offs (7, -40, 2, -31, 36) relative to the <b>root map</b> ratings [0, 40,
  68, 74, 25] to yield [7, 0, 70, 43, 61] proportionality, competitiveness, minority opportunity, compactness, and
  county-district splitting ratings, respectively.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <b>notable maps</b> suggest some major quantifiable policy trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Most Proportional map trades-off (100, -7, 32, 1, 68) for (100, 33, 100, 75, 93) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Competitive map trades-off (82, 36, 25, -44, 19) for (82, 76, 93, 30, 44) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Best Minority map trades-off (100, -7, 32, 1, 68) for (100, 33, 100, 75, 93) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Compact map trades-off (20, -22, 24, 26, 6) for (20, 18, 92, 100, 31) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Least Splitting map trades-off (39, -19, 30, -42, 75) for (39, 21, 98, 32, 100) ratings.</li>
</ul>
