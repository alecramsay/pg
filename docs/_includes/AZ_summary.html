<p>The official congressional map makes trade-offs (11, 12, 17, -19, 5) relative to the <b>root map</b> ratings [71,
  32, 67, 70, 21] to yield [82, 44, 84, 51, 26] proportionality, competitiveness, minority opportunity, compactness, and
  county-district splitting ratings, respectively.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <b>notable maps</b> suggest some major quantifiable policy trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Most Proportional map trades-off (29, 68, 1, 30, 59) for (100, 100, 68, 100, 80) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Competitive map trades-off (29, 68, 1, 30, 59) for (100, 100, 68, 100, 80) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Best Minority map trades-off (-2, 21, 31, -28, 31) for (69, 53, 98, 42, 52) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Compact map trades-off (29, 68, 1, 30, 59) for (100, 100, 68, 100, 80) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Least Splitting map trades-off (-3, 13, 0, -20, 64) for (68, 45, 67, 50, 85) ratings.</li>
