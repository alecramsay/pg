<p>The official congressional map makes trade-offs (38, 0, 15, -10, 33) relative to the <b>root map</b> ratings [62,
  33, 60, 56, 13] to yield [100, 33, 75, 46, 46] proportionality, competitiveness, minority opportunity, compactness,
  and
  county-district splitting ratings, respectively.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <b>notable maps</b> suggest some major quantifiable policy trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Most Proportional map trades-off (38, -3, 12, 2, 77) for (100, 30, 72, 58, 90) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Competitive map trades-off (33, 52, 0, -27, 27) for (95, 85, 60, 29, 40) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Best Minority map trades-off (38, -7, 23, -10, 21) for (100, 26, 83, 46, 34) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Compact map trades-off (-2, 0, 0, 24, 19) for (60, 33, 60, 80, 32) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Least Splitting map trades-off (20, 9, 2, -29, 81) for (82, 42, 62, 27, 94) ratings.</li>
