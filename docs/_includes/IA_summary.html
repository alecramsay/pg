<p>The official congressional map makes trade-offs (-41, 10, 0, -31, 60) relative to the <b>root map</b> ratings (41,
  75, 0, 84, 40) to yield (0, 85, 0, 53, 100) proportionality, competitiveness, minority opportunity, compactness, and
  county-district splitting ratings, respectively.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <b>notable maps</b> suggest some major quantifiable policy trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Most Proportional map trades-off (59, -52, 0, -48, 3) for (100, 23, 0, 36, 43) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Competitive map trades-off (8, 24, 0, -25, 57) for (49, 99, 0, 59, 97) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Best Minority map trades-off (3, 20, 0, 6, 59) for (44, 95, 0, 90, 99) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Compact map trades-off (31, -29, 0, 16, 33) for (72, 46, 0, 100, 73) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Least Splitting map trades-off (32, -28, 0, 10, 60) for (73, 47, 0, 94, 100) ratings.</li>
