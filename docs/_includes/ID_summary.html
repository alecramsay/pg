<p>The official congressional map makes trades-offs [0, 0, 0, -7, 25]<p>relative to the <b>root map</b> ratings [0, 0, 0, 56, 37]to yield [0, 0, 0, 49, 62] proportionality, competitiveness, minority opportunity, compactness, and county-district splitting ratings, respectively.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <b>notable maps</b> suggest some major quantifiable policy trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Most Competitive map trades-off [0, 29, 0, -56, -31] for [0, 29, 0, 0, 6] ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Compact map trades-off [0, 1, 0, 28, 11] for [0, 1, 0, 84, 48] ratings.</li>
  <li>The Least Splitting map trades-off [0, 1, 0, 0, 63] for [0, 1, 0, 56, 100] ratings.</li>
</ul>
