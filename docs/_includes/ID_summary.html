<p>The official congressional map makes trade-offs (0, 0, 0, -7, 25) relative to the <b>root map</b> ratings [0, 0, 0,
  56, 37] to yield [0, 0, 0, 49, 62] proportionality, competitiveness, minority opportunity, compactness, and
  county-district splitting ratings, respectively.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <b>notable maps</b> suggest some major quantifiable policy trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Most Competitive map trades-off (0, 29, 0, -56, -31) for (0, 29, 0, 0, 6) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Compact map trades-off (0, 1, 0, 28, 11) for (0, 1, 0, 84, 48) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Least Splitting map trades-off (0, 1, 0, 0, 63) for (0, 1, 0, 56, 100) ratings.</li>
