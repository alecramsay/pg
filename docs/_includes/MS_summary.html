<p>The official congressional map makes trade-offs (-8, -27, 0, 4, 31) relative to the <b>root map</b> ratings (17, 27,
  100, 61, 38) to yield (9, 0, 100, 65, 69) proportionality, competitiveness, minority opportunity, compactness, and
  county-district splitting ratings, respectively.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <b>notable maps</b> suggest some major quantifiable policy trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Most Proportional map trades-off (83, 4, 0, -22, 51) for (100, 31, 100, 39, 89) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Competitive map trades-off (48, 73, 0, -38, -6) for (65, 100, 100, 23, 32) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Best Minority map trades-off (43, 28, 0, 17, 61) for (60, 55, 100, 78, 99) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Compact map trades-off (20, 36, 0, 28, 5) for (37, 63, 100, 89, 43) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Least Splitting map trades-off (39, 24, 0, 2, 62) for (56, 51, 100, 63, 100) ratings.</li>
