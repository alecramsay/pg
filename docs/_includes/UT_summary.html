<p>The official congressional map makes trade-offs (-8, -7, 0, 7, -15) relative to the <b>root map</b> ratings [68, 7,
  0, 63, 15] to yield [60, 0, 0, 70, 0] proportionality, competitiveness, minority opportunity, compactness, and
  county-district splitting ratings, respectively.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <b>notable maps</b> suggest some major quantifiable policy trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Most Proportional map trades-off (32, 26, 0, 37, 67) for (100, 33, 0, 100, 82) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Competitive map trades-off (32, 29, 0, 1, 32) for (100, 36, 0, 64, 47) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Best Minority map trades-off (12, 11, 44, -32, 13) for (80, 18, 44, 31, 28) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Compact map trades-off (32, 26, 0, 37, 67) for (100, 33, 0, 100, 82) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Least Splitting map trades-off (32, 26, 0, 37, 67) for (100, 33, 0, 100, 82) ratings.</li>
