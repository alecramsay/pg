<p>The official congressional map makes trade-offs (14, -13, 1, -22, 58) relative to the <b>root map</b> ratings [86,
  46, 47, 81, 0] to yield [100, 33, 48, 59, 58] proportionality, competitiveness, minority opportunity, compactness, and
  county-district splitting ratings, respectively.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <b>notable maps</b> suggest some major quantifiable policy trade-offs:</p>
<ul>

  <li>The Most Competitive map trades-off (14, 48, -10, -54, 28) for (100, 94, 37, 27, 28) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Best Minority map trades-off (14, -17, 27, -58, 25) for (100, 29, 74, 23, 25) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Compact map trades-off (-86, -11, 2, 19, 4) for (0, 35, 49, 100, 4) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Least Splitting map trades-off (-1, -9, 2, -35, 89) for (85, 37, 49, 46, 89) ratings.</li>
