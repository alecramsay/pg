<p>The official congressional map makes trade-offs (-12, -12, -2, -18, 10) relative to the <b>root map</b> ratings [81,
  28, 83, 51, 30] to yield [69, 16, 81, 33, 40] proportionality, competitiveness, minority opportunity, compactness, and
  county-district splitting ratings, respectively.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <b>notable maps</b> suggest some major quantifiable policy trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Most Proportional map trades-off (19, 10, -2, 10, 27) for (100, 38, 81, 61, 57) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Competitive map trades-off (11, 28, -5, -19, 34) for (92, 56, 78, 32, 64) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Best Minority map trades-off (-35, -18, 9, -17, 2) for (46, 10, 92, 34, 32) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Compact map trades-off (-2, -7, -2, 46, 38) for (79, 21, 81, 97, 68) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Least Splitting map trades-off (-8, 0, 0, 10, 65) for (73, 28, 83, 61, 95) ratings.</li>
