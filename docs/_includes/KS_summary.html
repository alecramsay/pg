<p>The official congressional map makes trade-offs (0, -23, 0, -14, 58) relative to the <b>root map</b> ratings [0, 60,
  0, 70, 22] to yield [0, 37, 0, 56, 80] proportionality, competitiveness, minority opportunity, compactness, and
  county-district splitting ratings, respectively.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <b>notable maps</b> suggest some major quantifiable policy trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Most Proportional map trades-off (100, -31, 0, -17, 4) for (100, 29, 0, 53, 26) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Competitive map trades-off (20, 11, 0, -23, 12) for (20, 71, 0, 47, 34) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Best Minority map trades-off (39, -12, 50, -38, 4) for (39, 48, 50, 32, 26) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Compact map trades-off (19, 8, 0, 30, 75) for (19, 68, 0, 100, 97) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Least Splitting map trades-off (25, 0, 0, 6, 78) for (25, 60, 0, 76, 100) ratings.</li>
</ul>
