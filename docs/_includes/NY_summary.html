<p>The official congressional map makes trade-offs (7, -12, 15, -11, 36) relative to the <b>root map</b> ratings (70,
  36, 67, 74, 4) to yield (77, 24, 82, 63, 40) proportionality, competitiveness, minority opportunity, compactness, and
  county-district splitting ratings, respectively.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <b>notable maps</b> suggest some major quantifiable policy trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Most Proportional map trades-off (30, -7, 7, 1, 63) for (100, 29, 74, 75, 67) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Competitive map trades-off (30, 21, 4, -44, 28) for (100, 57, 71, 30, 32) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Best Minority map trades-off (-4, -26, 21, -49, 16) for (66, 10, 88, 25, 20) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Compact map trades-off (5, 5, 6, 24, 15) for (75, 41, 73, 98, 19) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Least Splitting map trades-off (11, -5, 6, -7, 73) for (81, 31, 73, 67, 77) ratings.</li>
</ul>
