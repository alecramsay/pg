<p>The official congressional map makes trade-offs (0, -2, -16, -7, 14) relative to the <b>root map</b> ratings (0, 3,
  35, 58, 15) to yield (0, 1, 19, 51, 29) proportionality, competitiveness, minority opportunity, compactness, and
  county-district splitting ratings, respectively.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <b>notable maps</b> suggest some major quantifiable policy trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Most Proportional map trades-off (73, 7, -10, -18, 8) for (73, 10, 25, 40, 23) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Competitive map trades-off (29, 35, 13, -19, 10) for (29, 38, 48, 39, 25) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Best Minority map trades-off (51, 22, 15, -20, 38) for (51, 25, 50, 38, 53) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Most Compact map trades-off (43, 23, 9, 20, 14) for (43, 26, 44, 78, 29) ratings.</li>
  <li>The Least Splitting map trades-off (5, 16, 10, 5, 84) for (5, 19, 45, 63, 99) ratings.</li>
</ul>
