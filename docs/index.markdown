<h2>Trade-offs in Redistricting</h2>

Redistricting involves trade-offs between various policy objectives. 
The population geography of a state frames these trade-offs. 
The choices that mapmakers made are revealed by comparing their map 
to the natural starting point for redistricting.

You can see an example of these trade-offs on the [Example](./_pages/example.markdown) page. 
You can choose a specific state on the [States](./_pages/states.markdown) page.

### Details

We explore two ideas here:

-   The most population compact map is the natural starting point for redistricting
    &#8212; all redistricting plans for a state are informed by it; and

-   Comparing redistricting plans to that starting point highlights the mix of policy
    choices (trade-offs) that the mapmakers made.

By population geography we mean how many people live where in a state.

From here on, **bolded** terms are defined on the [Glossary](./_pages/glossary.markdown) page.

In more detail:

1.  We introduce the concept of a **root plan** or **root map** that
    partitions a state's unique **population geography** into a set
    of districts with the lowest overall **edit distance** to all other valid maps.
    Due to computational limitations, one can only *approximate* the root map. 

2.  We argue that maximally **population compact** districts are the natural starting point for redistricting. 

    The fundamental principle of these maps is that people that live near each other will tend to be in the same district. 
    Moreover, this is a good heuristic for generating maps have very low overall edit distances to other valid maps. 

    The most geometrically compact map also tends to have low overall edit distances to other valid maps
    &#8212; slightly lower than population compact maps. 
    But as Chief Justice Earl Warren said in his landmark *Reynold v. Sims* decision, 
    "Legislators represent people, not trees or acres." so we prefer the population compactness heuristic.

    We believe it is natural to think of the maximally population-compact map for a state as a reference map 
    and other maps in terms of deltas from it.
    Hence, the heuristic we use to approximate root maps is to maximize population compactness.

    Roughly speaking, population-compact districts form a
    [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram).
 
    We impose three additional constraints on our approximation:

    -   Each district is contiguous
    -   No precincts are split, and
    -   **Population deviation** is 2% or less

    From an initial, random districting, our algorithm greedily searches
    for the most population-compact districting. Because this algorithm is
    not guaranteed to find the best districting, we run it 100 times and
    take the best qualifying map.

    By this definition, each state has exactly one root map.

3.  We generate proximal root maps for 42 states apportioned two or more
    congressional districts in the 2020 census. We exclude Hawaii and
    Maine, due to data issues.

4.  We compare these root maps to the five **notable maps**
    from Dave's Redistricting (DRA)
    for each state that individually optimize for proportionality,
    competitiveness, minority representation, compactness, and
    county-district splitting.

5.  Despite optimizing on these different dimensions, these maps share
    substantial **common core districts** with the root map, an average of
    nearly two thirds of the population-weighted assignments (65.9%).
    This reinforces our hypothesis that maximizing the overall
    population compactness of districts is a good way to characterize
    population geography.

6.  Then we compare the DRA **ratings**
    for these divergent maps to those for the root map showing some
    major quantifiable policy trade-offs inherent in congressional
    redistricting for each state. These contrasts put policy choices
    framed by the underlying population geography in sharp relief.

    Our root maps are not normative, not what we think redistricting
    plans *should* be. By definition, they are the natural starting
    point of redistricting. All redistricting plans for a state are
    unavoidably informed by them, so they provide a good baseline
    against which to evaluate and compare plans.

7.  Finally, we compare the official map for each state to the root
    districts showing the mix of policy choices (trade-offs) that each
    state made.

You can see a representative example of this analysis on the
[Example](./\_pages/example.markdown) page. You can choose a specific
state to look at, on the [States](./\_pages/states.markdown) page.

### Acknowledgements

We would like to thank DRA for the input data and
the wonderful platform for sharing our maps, 
the DRA user community for pushing the dimensional limits of congressional
redistricting in each state with their notable maps, and 
the VEST team for their election data making the partisan ratings in DRA possible. 
We would like to especially thank Terry Crowley for making 
the large scope of this project feasible.
