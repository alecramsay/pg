<h2>Trade-offs in Redistricting</h2>

Redistricting involves trade-offs between various policy objectives. 
The population geography of a state frames these trade-offs. 
The choices that mapmakers made are revealed by comparing their map to a map 
representing that underlying population geography. 

You can see an example of these trade-offs on the [Example](./_pages/example.markdown) page. 
You can choose a specific state on the [States](./_pages/states.markdown) page.

**Details**

We explore two ideas here:

-   The population geography of a state characterized as a set of
    districts is the natural starting point of redistricting -- all
    redistricting plans for a state are informed by them; and

-   Comparing redistricting plans to it highlights the mix of policy
    choices (trade-offs) that the mapmakers made.

By population geography we mean how many people live where in a state.

From here on, **bolded** terms are defined on the [Glossary](./_pages/glossary.markdown) page.

In more detail:

1.  We introduce the concept of a **root plan** or **root map** that
    characterizes a state's unique **population geography** as a set
    of districts. They are solely a function of total census
    population by geographic unit (**block** or **precinct**). We
    don't incorporate other criteria, such as preserving city or
    county boundaries, because the point is to abstract away any
    political considerations.

2.  We hypothesize that maximizing **population compactness** is a good
    heuristic for generating a proximal root map. Roughly speaking,
    the resulting districts form a
    [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram).
 
    We impose three additional constraints on our approximation:

    -   Each district is contiguous
    -   No precincts are split, and
    -   **Population deviation** is 2% or less

    From an initial, random districting, our algorithm greedily searches
    for the most population-compact districting. Because this algorithm is
    not guaranteed to find the best districting, we run it 100 times and
    take the best qualifying map.

    By this definition, each state has exactly one root map.

3.  We generate root maps for 42 states apportioned two or more
    congressional districts in the 2020 census. We exclude Hawaii and
    Maine, due to data issues.

4.  We compare these root maps to the five **notable maps**
    from Dave's Redistricting (DRA)
    for each state that individually optimize for proportionality,
    competitiveness, minority representation, compactness, and
    county-district splitting.

5.  Despite optimizing on these different dimensions, these maps share
    substantial **common core districts** with the root map, an average of
    nearly two thirds of the population-weighted assignments (65.9%).
    This reinforces our hypothesis that maximizing the overall
    population compactness of districts is a good way to characterize
    population geography.

6.  Then we compare the DRA **ratings**
    for these divergent maps to those for the root map showing some
    major quantifiable policy trade-offs inherent in congressional
    redistricting for each state. These contrasts put policy choices
    framed by the underlying population geography in sharp relief.

    Our root maps are not normative, not what we think redistricting
    plans *should* be. By definition, they are the natural starting
    point of redistricting. All redistricting plans for a state are
    unavoidably informed by them, so they provide a good baseline
    against which to evaluate and compare plans.

7.  Finally, we compare the official map for each state to the root
    districts showing the mix of policy choices (trade-offs) that each
    state made.

You can see a representative example of this analysis on the
[Example](./\_pages/example.markdown) page. You can choose a specific
state to look at, on the [States](./\_pages/states.markdown) page.

**Next Steps**

Going forward, we want to test two further hypotheses:

1.  Root maps are relatively robust and relatively invariant to the
    specific approach used to generating approximations -- We have
    used Balzer's capacity-constrained Voronoi tessellations. We want
    to a\) explore alternate distance functions for our Balzer's
    Voronoi algorithm and b\) explore rectangular tilings.

2.  Our population compactness heuristic and its variants (from #1) are
    among the maps with the largest common core districts with respect to
    other maps in a large ensemble of randomly generated maps for a
    state.

**Acknowledgements**

We would like to thank Dave\'s Redistricting for the input data
and the wonderful platform for sharing our maps and the DRA user
community for pushing the dimensional limits of congressional
redistricting in each state with their notable maps. We would like to
especially thank Terry Crowley for making the large scope of this
project feasible.
