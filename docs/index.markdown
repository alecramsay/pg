<h2>Trade-offs in Redistricting</h2>

Redistricting involves trade-offs between various policy objectives. 
The population geography of a state &#8212; how many people live where &#8212; frames these trade-offs. 
A mapmaker’s choices are revealed by comparing their map to the natural starting point for redistricting in that state.

{% assign baseline-png = baseline-png | strip_newlines %}

{% assign state = site.data.states | where:"xx", xx | first %}

{% capture baseline-link %}

{% endcapture %}
{% assign baseline-link = baseline-link | strip_newlines %}

That natural starting point for redistricting is a map that is maximally population compact 
&#8212; people who live near each other tend to be in the same district. 
We call this a root map.

Other maps for a state can be described as deltas from it, 
like the points in a coordinate system are described relative to the origin. 
Root maps aren’t normative. 
The potential plans for a state are unavoidably informed by the root map 
which makes it a good baseline against which to compare them.

For each state, we compare the five [notable maps](https://medium.com/dra-2020/notable-maps-66d744933a48) 
in [Dave's Redistricting](https://davesredistricting.org/) (DRA) 
&#8212; which optimize for proportionality, competitiveness, minority representation, compactness, and county-district splitting &#8212; to the root map using 
the DRA [ratings](https://medium.com/dra-2020/ratings-deep-dive-c03290659b7)
that use a scale of [0--100] where bigger is always better. 
We do the same for the official map. 
These comparisons show some major quantifiable trade-offs inherent in congressional redistricting for a state.
